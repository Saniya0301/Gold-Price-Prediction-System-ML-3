# Gold Price Prediction System 🪙📈

A machine learning-based system to predict future gold prices using historical data. This project leverages data science techniques to help investors, researchers, and analysts make data-driven decisions in gold trading and investment.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds and trains a regression-based machine learning model to predict gold prices. It utilizes historical datasets, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics to deliver accurate predictions.

### 🎯 Key Goals:
- Analyze historical gold price data
- Build a predictive model using ML algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate model performance
- Predict future gold prices based on current market indicators

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost (machine learning)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
